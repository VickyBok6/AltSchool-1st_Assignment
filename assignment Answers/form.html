            Through its unique capacities as the world’s premier vehicle for international cooperation, the UN system plays a crucial role in coordinating assistance of all kinds — to help Africa help itself. From promoting the development of democratic institutions, to establishing peace between warring nations, the UN is present on the ground supporting economic and social development and the promotion and protection of human rights.

            In this effort, the UN works closely with Africa’s regional cooperation mechanisms and has five active peacekeeping operations at present. UN peacekeepers serve in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO), Western Sahara (MINURSO), South Sudan (UNMISS) and in the disputed Abyei area (UNISFA).

            To advance its support for Africa even further, the United Nations Office of the Special Adviser on Africa was established in 2003 to enhance international support for African development and security and to improve coordination of UN system support. It also works to facilitate global deliberations on Africa, particularly with respect to the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) — a strategic framework adopted by African leaders in 2001. In 2018, NEPAD's mandate was reformed and transformed into the African Union Development Agency-NEPAD (AUDA-NEPAD). It is now serving as the first development agency of the African Union.active peacekeeping operations at present.
