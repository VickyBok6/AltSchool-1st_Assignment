        <h2>My Work</h2>
        <p>Presently, i am undergoing a training i Altschool Africa
            in software engineering as a front end developer which is the stack i have chosen.
            we have been deeing on HTML,CSS and JS which are the content for first semester.
            HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) structures web content, defining elements like 
            text, images, and links. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) styles this content, 
            controlling layout, colors, and fonts. JavaScript (JS) adds interactivity, 
            enabling dynamic content, animations, and user interactions. 
            Together, they form the core technologies of modern web development.
        </p>
        <p>HTML5 is the latest version of the HTML standard, offering new elements like article, section
            multimedia support without plugins, enhanced form controls, and improved accessibility and performance for modern web development across devices.
